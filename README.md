# Enhancing Aerial Image Segmentation: A Comparative Analysis of Machine Learning Approaches

## Project Description

This project provides two complete pipelines for semantic segmentation of aerial imagery:

- **SegFormer-based Pretrained Segmentation**  
- **SAM + Heuristic-based Classification**

The purpose of this project is to efficiently perform segmentation without model training by leveraging powerful pretrained models. It enables users to generate semantic masks for road, green area, and building classes and evaluate their segmentation quality using robust metrics.

### Key Features

- üìå Pretrained SegFormer-B5 model for fast and accurate inference.
- üìå Segment Anything Model (SAM) integration with heuristic-based classification.
- üìå Professional evaluation pipeline: Pixel Accuracy, IoU, Dice Score, Precision, Recall, and F1 Score.
- üìå Modular code structure for easy customization.
